# HostelMate

**HostelMate** is a smart mobile solution designed to streamline hostel maintenance and lost & found systems for students and caretakers.The app addresses real-world inefficiencies in handling complaints and recovering lost items using Firebase and AI technologies.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In many hostels, maintenance issues are reported informally — through WhatsApp groups, verbal communication, or handwritten logs — leading to:

- Lost or ignored complaints
- No transparency or tracking
- Slow resolution cycles

Additionally, there is no central system for managing **lost & found** items, a frequent issue in hostel environments.

---

## ✅ Solution Overview

**HostelMate** provides two key features:

### 1. Maintenance Complaint System
- Submit complaints with category, description, and image
- Track the status of complaints: Pending → In Progress → Resolved
- Admin dashboard for caretakers and wardens

### 2. Lost & Found Portal
- Upload details and image of lost/found items
- AI-assisted tagging and smart match suggestions using Gemini API
- View matched and recent posts easily
